First you should be in the repository project2024-server on branch called cpp-server.
For running the js server you need to run in the terminal:
npm run start

The js server running on the port you wrote on .env.local file in the config folder.
If you dont have those you should open new folder at the project root called "config" and add a .env.local file.
My .env.local is this (with connection to mongodb also):
CONNECTION_STRING='mongodb://localhost:27017/youtube'
PORT=8080

The client is served from the server at http://localhost:8080/

* You have in this project file called script.js with a script for the mongoDb data.
